## About

> I am a passionate full-stack developer from Nigeria

I build web projects with Ruby, Ruby on Rail and Iâ€™m currently building more with React.js and Node.js. Other awesome technologies I use from time to time is Gatsby.js, React Native (using expo).
I have also have a good knowledge of data analytics with python.
